Learning and improving the Coinbase tutorial https://developers.coinbase.com/

Please run these to see how coinbase works, and which inconsistencies & typos I have found in the official (Python) tutorial.

* [cbPersonal.py](cb/cbPersonal.py) = your API key goes here. Do all this with a [sandbox](https://sandbox.coinbase.com) account!
* [cbWallet.py](cb/cbWallet.py) = Guides ... [Create a wallet](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/guides/bitcoin-wallet)
* [cbSendRequest.py](cb/cbSendRequest.py) = Guides ... [Send and Receive BTC](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/guides/send-receive)
* [cbBuySellBtc.py](cb/cbBuySellBtc.py) = Guides ... [Buy and Sell BTC](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/guides/buy-sell)
* [cbPriceData.py](cb/cbPriceData.py) = Guides ... [Price Data](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/guides/price-data)

The latter produces (among other things) a neat table of [all the currencies](output/1BitcoinInAllCurrencies-20160110.txt) (In non-fantasy exchange rates only when not on sandbox but on real api.).

All this is work in progress ... current version:

# v01
