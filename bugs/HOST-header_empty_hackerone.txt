Empty=Invalid HOST header in notifications sent to IP addresses

The consequence:
Django refuses to accept your POST requests, with this debug-logging error message:

"Invalid HTTP_HOST header: ''. The domain name provided is not valid according to RFC 1034/1035."


It probably(?!)  happens because your notifications are sent to my IP-address-only server (without a DNS entry).

Please see these detailed descriptions here:
https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/coinbaseTestbed/blob/master/bugs/HOST-header_empty.md

I even created a test server where you can see the bug live: http://208.68.38.174/


I know this is not a security breach bug. 
But it is a real bug, your notifications do not comply with RFC 1034/1035.
And it has cost me a lot of time to find, pin down, and document well. Please reward my work.

Thanks a lot.
Andreas

Hi,

Bugs without security implications should be reported to support@coinbase.com. Based on your initial description, there do not appear to be any security implications as a direct result of this behavior. If you disagree, please reply with additional information describing your reasoning. Including a working proof-of-concept can be incredibly helpful in our assessment of these claims.

Hi ttoko
Thx for your quick answer.

Including a working proof-of-concept can be incredibly helpful in our assessment of these claims.

Yes, I know. That is why I put so much work into this:

I even created a test server where you can see the bug live: http://208.68.38.174/

Thanks.

We're going to investigate this and put out a fix if it's reproducible but there are no security implications so this wouldn't be eligible for a bounty.

Thanks a lot.

no security implications

There is indeed a security implication. A "domino effect security implication". 
Your bug forces Django apps to run with highly insecure settings.

See chapter "Bug" in README of my Coinbase example app /buyme/

https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/buyme#bug

That /buyme/ is actually the app with which I originally found that bug in your system.

This issue is now fixed. I maintain there are no direct security implications here; a production environment with a domain name and SSL enabled would not have encountered this bug.

I can no longer reproduce this bug. The Host header is being set correctly afaict.

Closing an issue which is not solved ... is rude.

But you seem to have only one goal in mind - not to pay. That is not my goal, so you are loosing me now.

I am not wasting much more of my precious time on your faulty system.

Go through my repo, and you will find many more bugs, typos, sloppyness, outright mess ... that I had identified while I worked through the tutorial. https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/coinbaseTestbed Especially look at all the code in the /cb/ folder.

Or don't.

Why do you think I am writing:

| Nope:
| http://208.68.38.174/

1) Go there.
2) Read.
3) Do it. Pay with sandbox money, come back to the same page. 
4) Reload. examine the response.

This is what I see. Now. 
After your "fix".

The "Host: " field is still empty.

Ah, you were testing using the sandbox. The fix had not yet been deployed to sandbox, only production.

Fix is now deployed to sandbox as well.

Finally. Congrats. Unbelievable - you've really done it.
Well done, my dear. Is everything in Coinbase such hardship?

Have a nice life.
