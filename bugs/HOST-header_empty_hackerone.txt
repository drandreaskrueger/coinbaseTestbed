Empty=Invalid HOST header in notifications sent to IP addresses

The consequence:
Django refuses to accept your POST requests, with this debug-logging error message:

"Invalid HTTP_HOST header: ''. The domain name provided is not valid according to RFC 1034/1035."


It probably(?!)  happens because your notifications are sent to my IP-address-only server (without a DNS entry).

Please see these detailed descriptions here:
https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/coinbaseTestbed/blob/master/bugs/HOST-header_empty.md

I even created a test server where you can see the bug live: http://208.68.38.174/


I know this is not a security breach bug. 
But it is a real bug, your notifications do not comply with RFC 1034/1035.
And it has cost me a lot of time to find, pin down, and document well. Please reward my work.

Thanks a lot.
Andreas
